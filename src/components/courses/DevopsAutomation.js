            <h3>DevOps and Automation</h3>
            <p>The movement of workloads to the cloud has generated new requirements for responsiveness and repeatability. 
                Many IT departments have migrated to the cloud in the same manner that they ran IT on‐premise for the past 20 years. 
                In this new era of micro services, automated testing, and infrastructure as code, IT’s success depends on its 
                ability to work with stakeholders and adapt to changing requirements while maintaining reliable and automated results. 
                DevOps and Automation are key to meeting these new expectations, but their success depends on a different approach and a change in culture.</p>
            <p>Those who transition to the DevOps model and collaborate to integrate development and IT operations can rapidly
                 pull away from their competitors in today’s fast‐paced market.</p>

            <h3>Keys to Success</h3>
            <p>When moving to an integrated DevOps model, the biggest change is often a cultural one. 
                These guidelines will help you stay on the right track:</p>
            <ul className="items">
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Speed Releases —</strong> Stay focused on the continuous delivery of applications and stop focusing on IT infrastructure and management.</li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Automated Processes —</strong> Stop building environments and executing tests manually; use an automated, continuous integration process instead.</li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Remove IT Barriers —</strong> Accelerate provisioning by using a templated catalog to build test and production environments.</li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Accelerate Testing —</strong>Instead of relying on lengthy and time-consuming waterfall methods, design and build smaller pieces of functionality to test large systems.</li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Test First, Not Last — </strong>Write automated test cases prior to building code.</li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <strong>Plan Ahead —</strong> Build a culture where developers and IT operators collaborate throughout a process. Determine what infrastructure your application will need before the developers finish.</li>
                </ul>
         </div>

            <h3>The Solutions</h3>
            <p>DevOps requires new skills, a new way of thinking, and a new place to start.
                 To ease the transition, Aurum Data Solutions Inc (ADSI) has designed
                  a DevOps service team. This team is comprised of experienced 
                  professionals who are ready to help with the following:</p>
            <ul className="items">
                <li className="list-items">
                <h4> DevOpsAssessments:</h4>
                Know how your company uses automation to maintain higher quality, align with development organizations, 
                and produce quicker and more reliable deployments. Understand what technology and process changes will help
                 your organization respond to business needs and provide continuous improvement of all IT services.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <h4>Process Automation:</h4>
                Start with manual processes that consume the organization’s time. Automate daily manual tasks such as reboots, 
                provisioning, and patching cycles. Eliminate manual errors and reduce downtime of all affected products and services.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <h4> Compliance and Configuration Management:</h4>
                ADSI can automate your configuration deployment, maintain its compliance, and manage its lifecycle until the 
                resources are returned to the pool using industry-leading, open source tools. Take the first step in supporting 
                an Infrastructure as Code paradigm and create the building blocks necessary to move into full continuous automation.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <h4>Advanced Virtualization Use Cases:</h4>
                Take advantage of your existing VMWare spend. Cut your turnaround time from weeks to minutes on standardized
                 and compliant virtual machines. Utilize your existing automation and configuration management processes within 
                 the context of a greater process. Turn automated provisioning into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                <h4> Continuous Improvement /Development for Infrastructure and Application Code:</h4>
                    Take an agile, iterative approach to the development of your infrastructure code. Form and manage your infrastructure
                     code with the same processes and technology as your application code, and then deploy them together in a repeatable
                      and manageable way. Deploy new features faster and more reliably with little manual interaction or cumbersome 
                      release management tools.
                </li>
