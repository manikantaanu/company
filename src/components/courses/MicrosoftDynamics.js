            <h3>Our Dynamics 365/CRM Implementation Methodology</h3>
            <p>Ensuring the transparency of the project development, we have successfully adopted Microsoft Sure‐Step Implementation Methodology.
                 This solid approach includes prescriptive phase‐by‐phase, activity‐by‐activity descriptions for implementing, upgrading, or 
                 migrating projects. Sure‐Step Methodology allows you to easily monitor your project a from the earliest stages of development
                  to deployment, thus empowering us to bring you the best service possible.</p>
            <p>Our methodology is split into several flexible stages, which can be easily altered to suit your company requirements:</p>
            <ul className="items">
                <li className="list-items">
                    <h4>Diagnostics</h4>
                    The very first step is to identify essential business processes and assess infrastructure. To create a project 
                    plan we work it through with our clients. This allows us to determine the best project management approach as well as to define its scope.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    ADSI consultants closely work with our client key managers to effectively analyze, outline, document and plan key business processes.
                     This analysis allows us to define project requirements crucial to unlock an enormous potential of Dynamics CRM
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                    <h4>Design</h4>
                        We determine the best strategy to configure and implement business requirements. During this stage we customize the software to 
                        fit your specific needs by finalizing initial documentation — from modifying the user interface to modifying reports; from 
                        mapping and designing data migration processes to configuring custom code development.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                    <h4>Development</h4>
                        We produce and test the code for the customizations, as well as for the data migration. We adapt existing features,
                         develop new functions and complete the system configuration. Then, we rigorously test the functionality and security
                          of these solutions, ensuring the superior quality of delivered products.
                </li>
                <li className="list-items">
                    <h4>Deployment</h4>
                        ADSI creates the client’s operational Microsoft Dynamics CRM environment by installing, configuring, and deploying features.
                         We then ensure full functionality by performing comprehensive system level audit (Performance Testing, User Acceptance Tests, etc.).
